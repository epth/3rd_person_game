# 3rd_person_game
my first game,the 3rd person game

## About:

Currently this project is just a demo,the sword man can't damage the wolf man,and there is a shooter **ass6.5.tscn** exist in the Scene directory,you can replace the swordman in world scene with it,maybe its a worth trying for newer to godot.
    
## Tip:

To open this project you need build Godot with module [futari-addon](https://gitlab.com/polymorphcool/futari-addon)  ,otherwise may cause crash:tscn cant open etc..
