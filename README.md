# 3rd_person_game
my first game,the 3rd person game

To open this project with godot,you need a godot module that called futari addon,otherwise maybe cause crash.
this is the link:https://gitlab.com/polymorphcool/futari-addon

Currently this project is just a demo,the sword man will not attack the wolf man,and there is a shooter tscn exist in the Scene directory,you can replace the swordman with it,maybe its a worth trying for newer to godot.
