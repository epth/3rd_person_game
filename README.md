# 3rd_person_game
my first game,the 3rd person game

About:
    Currently this project is just a demo,the sword man will not attack the wolf man,and there is a shooter tscn exist in the Scene directory,you can replace the swordman with it,maybe its a worth trying for newer to godot.
    
Tip:
    To open this project you need build Godot with module futari-addon,otherwise may cause crash:tscn cant open etc..
